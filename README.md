Instagram

I use Instagram at least 3 times a day, to know the updates. I see Instagram to inspire myself and as insight to known & explore the things which I am not aware. Below are the reasons, I enjoy myself to use Instagram.

1. I started using yearly planner, where I am able to track my personal & professional goals daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly
2. I started writing gratitude journaling, for which I spend half an hour for myself to know well about me for what I am happy, sad/worried, lazy, regrets, any ideas and a question to myself.
3. I follow inspiring men & women, from whom I get motivated every single day
4. I started listening to Podcasts

6. I am experimenting with new recipes to cook
7. I get to know the travel ideas and explore those places
8. I come across TED Talks
9. I follow fashion, self-care and design ideas from the people out there
10. I share my ideas

I am interested in working with React and React related technologies.
1. React Core Team comes with new design updates
2. One of the light weight framework considering the React Fibre Architecture
3. More emerging React related technologies which makes coding and design much more easier.

### Among the projects you have worked on, which one are you  most proud of? What were your tasks in the project, and how did you use your knowledge/skills to come up with the solution?

I am proud of all the projects I worked. In particular, I am most proud working for my current Project (MGM International resorts)

Because,
1. I develop test driven, reusable and responsive react component every single day.
2. The work I do is challenging with tight deadlines.
3. I am enthusiastic to work collaboratively with all the stake holders and get the work done.
4. I am responsible for the work I do. So, my seniors trust me with my work.
5. I mentor/help my peers from the technology I learnt recently and share my experiences
6. I speak up on time to my seniors if there are any dependencies / blockage to continue with my work
